# Ethereum Bank Smart Contract

1. Implement advanced Solidity concepts like ownership, modifiers, and interest calculations.
2. Introduce state variables and custom functions to manage interest rates and ownership.
3. Test on Remix IDE (https://remix.ethereum.org/)

## Requirements:
### Smart Contract Features:

1. Deposit Function: Allow users to deposit Ether into the contract.
2. Withdraw Function: Allow users to withdraw Ether, with checks for sufficient balance.
3. Interest Calculation: Implement a function to calculate and display interest based on the user's balance and an interest rate set by the contract owner.
4. Owner-Specific Functions: Allow the contract owner to set the interest rate. Allow the owner to withdraw all funds from the contract for administrative purposes.
5. Security: Use modifiers to restrict access to owner-only functions. Validate all inputs to prevent misuse.
6. Interaction: Use different accounts in Remix to test ownership restrictions and user-specific balances.
